AXP202/AXP209 device tree bindings

The axp20x family current members :
axp202 (X-Powers)
axp209 (X-Powers)

Required properties:
- compatible: "x-powers,axp202" or "x-powers,axp209"
- reg: The I2C slave address for the AXP chip
- interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller
- interrupts: SoC NMI / GPIO interrupt connected to the PMIC's IRQ pin
- interrupt-controller: axp20x has its own internal IRQs
- #interrupt-cells: Should be set to 1
- regulators: A node that houses a sub-node for each regulator. The regulators
	      are bound using their name as listed here: dcdc2, dcdc3, ldo1,
	      ldo2, ldo3, ldo4, ldo5.  The bindings details of individual
	      regulator device can be found in:
	      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt with
	      the exception of x-powers,dcdc-freq. Regulators not used should
	      still be listed for completeness and that the regulator subsystem
	      properly registers them.

- x-powers,dcdc-freq: defines the work frequency of DC-DC in KHz
		      (range: 750-1875). Default: 1.5MHz

Optional properties:
- regulator supplies - may be omitted if inputs are unregulated, such as using
		       the IPSOUT output from the PMIC
  - acin-supply: The input supply for LDO1
  - vin2-supply: The input supply for DCDC2
  - vin3-supply: The input supply for DCDC3
  - ldo24in-supply: The input supply for LDO2, LDO4
  - ldo3in-supply: The input supply for LDO3
  - ldo5in-supply: The input supply for LDO5

Optional properties for DCDC regulators:
- x-powers,dcdc-workmode: 1 for PWM mode, 0 for AUTO (PWM/PFM) mode
			  Default: AUTO mode
			  The DCDC regulators work in a mixed PWM/PFM mode,
			  using PFM under light loads and switching to PWM
			  for heavier loads. Forcing PWM mode trades efficiency
			  under light loads for lower output noise. This
			  probably makes sense for HiFi audio related
			  applications that aren't battery constrained.

Example:

axp209: pmic@34 {
	compatible = "x-powers,axp209";
	reg = <0x34>;
	interrupt-parent = <&nmi_intc>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;

	regulators {
		x-powers,dcdc-freq = <1500>;

		vdd_cpu: dcdc2 {
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1450000>;
			regulator-name = "vdd-cpu";
		};

		vdd_int_dll: dcdc3 {
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1400000>;
			regulator-name = "vdd-int-dll";
		};

		vdd_rtc: ldo1 {
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1400000>;
			regulator-name = "vdd-rtc";
		};

		avcc: ldo2 {
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-min-microvolt = <2700000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-name = "avcc";
		};

		ldo3 {
			/* unused */
		};

		csi1_io_2v8: ldo4 {
			/* output on extension headers */
			regulator-name = "csi1-io-2v8";
		};
	};
};
